## Squirrel_Project: Group 64

The application we built can be used to track the squirrels in the central park, and allows users to add, edit
squirrel‘s information, and related map and general stats would be updated in a real-time basis.

### Management Commands

Users could use the following 2 commands: 
##### python manage.py import_squirrel_data /path/to/file.csv
